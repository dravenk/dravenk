Hi, my name is Loong. 
ðŸ¤”Due to the job requirements, I became a full stack engineer. I use Golang and PHP as the primary back-end languages in my work. I used HTML, SCSS, Javascript to build the front end interface. The docker-compose deployment application is currently used.
I participated in the Google Summer of Code 2019 as a student developer. I am a volunteer and mentor of Google-Code-in. I am a contributor to the Druapl community.
I was a development project leader for a small team of five people. I try to do better.
